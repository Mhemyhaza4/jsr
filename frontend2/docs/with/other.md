title: Using JSR with any tool
description: Learn how to use JSR packages with any tool.

You can use JSR with any tool that supports ES modules, and either has native
support for JSR, or supports npm packages using `node_modules`.

If your tool has native support for JSR, you can use
[native JSR imports](/docs/using-packages#native-jsr-imports).

If your tool doesn't have native support for JSR, you can use
[JSR's npm compatibility layer](/docs/npm-compatibility).
